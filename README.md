</br>The information in MapKU will help KU Jayhawks finding KU campus buildings and be able to attend their classes on time because it can calculate the route between each building. This web will be very helpful for freshmen, help them figure out the locations of their classes, and the fastest way to get there. Moreover, the web has markers for KU campus buildings and information panels to show the building's information.
